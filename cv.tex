    \item Creating a tool to allow Tableau Prep customers to view and analyze their logs using Tableau
    \item Added functionality to allow client teams' usage of Tableau Prep to be individually tracked
    \item Coordinated cross-team efforts to remove insecure dependencies from Tableau Prep's Gradle builds
    \item Designed and implemented a rework of the Tableau error-asserting framework to replace frequently misused APIs with hygienic versions and sensible defaults
    \item Improved performance of the preflight CI pipeline using profiling tools, preventing hangs on large PRs and reducing time taken by over 50\% on small PRs
    \item Wrote a technical specification for and prototyped a tool that detects and triages SLA-impacting defects for Tableau services using httpd logs
    \item Set up Snowflake data sources using ETLs written in Apache Flink and Kafka and created Tableau visualizations using those data sources to prioritize improvements to service observability
    \item As scrum lead, identified, triaged, and prioritized bugs causing customer-facing errors to drive availability of VizQL Server in Tableau Online from 99.5\% to 99.9\%
    \item Unified VizQL Server health checks, removing a class of high-visibility defects in Tableau Public by enabling the server to consistently self-heal
    \item Contributed features for Tableau's telemetry/resource tracing library aimed at helping developers debug cross-language performance issues
    \item Identified, triaged, debugged, and fixed critical shipblocking production defects using Splunk, Tableau, and New Relic
