  \entry{06/18 - 06/19}{Research and Development Intern}{Sandia National Labs}
  {
    \item Contributed to parallelization facilities for PEBBL, a C++ framework for solving branch-and-bound problems. 
    \item Wrote dynamic MPI code with a focus on minimizing communication overhead and maintaining legacy compatibility.
  }
  \entry{01/19 -}{Member}{Stony Brook Algorithms Lab}
  {
    \item Discuss research topics in the theory of computer science.
    \item We read papers on topics related to the theory of computer science and present the topics to one another.
   }

\begin{cvsection}{projects}
  \entry{Fall 2018}{Canvassing Application}{}
  {
    \item A web app written in JavaScript and Python for managing door-to-door campaigns. 
    \item Interface with Google VRP solver
    \item Information stored using MongoDB
    \item Group project, worked mostly on the backend, query writing. say microservice
  }
  \entry{Spring 2018}{Peer-to-peer Filesystem}{}
  {
    \item Written using the FUSE bindings for Python. 
    \item P2P network hosted by a multithreaded bootstrap server. Runs over a custom protocol.
    \item Functionality similar to Airdrop. Mountable on Linux and MacOS.
  }
  \entry{Spring 2018}{Packet Sniffer}{}
  {
    \item Implemented using raw sockets in Python. 
    \item Dumps packets to human-readable, hex, or pcapng (Wireshark-readable) formats as desired. 
    \item Optionally filters packets by protocol.
  }
  \entry{Fall 2017}{Dynamic Memory Allocator}{}
  {
    \item Developed in C, using a first-fit allocation policy.
    \item Stores free blocks with a variable-size segmented free-list.
    \item Implements some optimizations from glibc malloc, ex: wilderness block.
  }
  \entry{Fall 2017}{Shell}{}
  {
    \item Written in C with bash-like features and syntax, including output redirection, piping, and background jobs. 
    \item Carefully implements UNIX signal handling and process life-cycle management.
  }
  \entry{Fall 2016}{Navigation System}{}
  {
    \item Developed in Java using the OpenStreetMap API and an XML parser, with functionality similar to Google Maps.
    \item Wrote a custom implementation of Djikstra's shortest-path algorithm for directions.
  }
