\begin{cvsection}{Experience}
  \entry{Software Engineering MTS, VizQL Server -- Tableau (Salesforce)}{01/20 - Present}
  {
    \item Propagating exception metadata across the Tableau monolith to identify and prioritize SLA-impacting defects
    \item Enabled client teams to debug cross-language performance issues through contributions to Tableau's C++/Java telemetry library
    \item Set up Snowflake data sources using ETLs written in Apache Flink and Kafka and created Tableau visualizations using those data sources to improve service observability
    \item Identified and triaged key sources of customer dissatisfaction in Tableau Online using Tableau and Splunk visualizations tracking golden signals and other metrics
    \item As scrum master, organized scrum backlog and prioritized tasks to improve availability of VizQL Server in Tableau Online from 99.5\% to 99.9\%.
    \item Wrote design documents and technical specifications for automation to automatically detect and triage SLA-impacting defects across the Analytics org
    \item Removed a class of high-visibility defects in Tableau Public by unifying VizQL Server health checks, enabling the server to consistently self-heal
    \item Identified and helped debug critical shipblocking production issues using Splunk, Tableau, and New Relic
  }
  \entry{Research and Development Intern -- Sandia National Laboratories}{06/18 - 08/19}
  {
    \item Enabled a client team to solve constrained-optimization problems of interest by adding a parallelization layer for a C++ branch-and-bound solver framework.
    \item Wrote dynamic MPI code suitable for use in high-performance computing scenarios.
  }
  \entry{Teaching Assistant -- Theory of Computation}{Spring 2018/19}
  {
    \item Wrote and graded homework and exams on automata, languages, Turing machines, and complexity
    \item Lectured the class as a substitute and held regular office hours
  }
  \entry{Teaching Assistant -- Foundations of Computer Science}{Spring 2017}
  {
    \item Helped a 25-person weekly recitation section learn discrete math, logic, and proofs
  }
