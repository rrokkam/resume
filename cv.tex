\section{my experience}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry{2019-}{Stony Brook Algorithms Lab}
    {discuss algorithms + learn, present.}
  \entry{06/18 - 06/19}{Research and Development Intern, Center for Computing Research, Sandia National Labs}
    {Contributed to parallelization facilities for PEBBL, a C++ framework for solving branch-and-bound problems. Wrote dynamic MPI code with a focus on minimizing communication overhead and maintaining legacy compatibility.}
\end{entrylist}

\section{my projects}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry{2018}{Peer-to-peer Filesystem}
    {A distributed filesystem similar to Airdrop, written using the FUSE bindings for Python. The P2P network is hosted by a multithreaded bootstrap server. Mountable on Linux and MacOS.}
  \entry{2018}{Terminal Chat Service}
    {A terminal chat client in C with a concurrent server written in Python. Sends messages using a custom plaintext protocol.}
  \entry{2018}{Packet Sniffer}
    {A packet sniffer implemented using raw sockets in Python. Dumps packets to human-readable, hex, or pcapng (Wireshark-readable) formats as desired. Optionally filters packets by protocol.}
  \entry{2017}{Dynamic Memory Allocation Library}
    {A memory allocator developed in C, using a first-fit allocation policy. Stores free blocks with a variable-size segmented free-list. Implements several optimizations found in glibc malloc, such as use of a wilderness block.}
  \entry{2017}{Shell}
    {A shell written in C with bash-like features, including output redirection, piping, and background jobs. Carefully implements UNIX signal handling and manages the life cycle of spawned processes.}
  \entry{2016}{Navigation System}
    {A Google Maps-like application developed in Java using the OpenStreetMap API and an XML parser, using a custom implementation of Djikstra's shortest-path algorithm for route computation.}
\end{entrylist}

\section{my teaching}

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry{2018, 19}{Teaching Assistant: Theory of Computation}
    {Wrote \& graded homework and exams on finite automata, formal languages, Turing machines, and complexity theory.}
  \entry{2017}{Teaching Assistant: Foundations of Computer Science}
    {Instructed 20-person recitation section on discrete math, logic, and proof techniques.}
\end{entrylist}
