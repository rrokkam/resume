\begin{entrylist}{experience}
  \entry{06/18 - 06/19}{Research and Development Intern, Center for Computing Research, Sandia National Labs}
    {Contributed to parallelization facilities for PEBBL, a C++ framework for solving branch-and-bound problems. Wrote dynamic MPI code with a focus on minimizing communication overhead and maintaining legacy compatibility.}
    \entry{01/19 -}{Member, Stony Brook Algorithms Lab}
    {Discuss research topics in the theory of computer science. We read papers on topics related to the theory of computer science and present the topics to one another.}
\end{entrylist}

\begin{entrylist}{projects}
  \entryy{Fall 2018}{Canvassing Application}{}
  {
    \item A web app written in JavaScript and Python for managing door-to-door campaigns. 
    \item Interface with Google VRP solver
    \item Information stored using MongoDB
    \item Group project, worked mostly on the backend, query writing. say microservice
  }
  \entry{Spring 2018}{Peer-to-peer Filesystem}
    {Written using the FUSE bindings for Python. The P2P network is hosted by a multithreaded bootstrap server and runs over a custom protocol. Functionality similar to Airdrop. Mountable on Linux and MacOS.}
  \entry{Spring 2018}{Packet Sniffer}
    {Implemented using raw sockets in Python. Dumps packets to human-readable, hex, or pcapng (Wireshark-readable) formats as desired. Optionally filters packets by protocol.}
  \entry{Fall 2017}{Dynamic Memory Allocator}
    {Developed in C, using a first-fit allocation policy. Stores free blocks with a variable-size segmented free-list. Implements several optimizations found in glibc malloc, such as use of a wilderness block.}
  \entry{Fall 2017}{Shell}
    {A shell written in C with bash-like features, including output redirection, piping, and background jobs. Carefully implements UNIX signal handling and manages the life cycle of spawned processes.}
  \entry{Fall 2016}{Navigation System}
    {A Google Maps-like application developed in Java using the OpenStreetMap API and an XML parser, using a custom implementation of Djikstra's shortest-path algorithm for route computation.}
\end{entrylist}

\begin{entrylist}{teaching}
  \entry{Spring 2018/19}{Teaching Assistant: Theory of Computation}
    {Wrote \& graded homework and exams on finite automata, formal languages, Turing machines, and complexity theory.}
  \entry{Spring 2017}{Teaching Assistant: Foundations of Computer Science}
    {Instructed 20-person recitation section on discrete math, logic, and proof techniques.}
\end{entrylist}

\begin{entrylist}{personal}
  \entry{Fall 2017 - Spring 2019}{Stony Brook Go Club}
  {Secretary, dc trip, gotham
  }
  \entry{Fall 2017 - Spring 2018}{SBU Undergrad Algorithms Reading Group}
  {Present algorithms and data structures of interest.
  }
