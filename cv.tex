\begin{cvsection}{Experience}
  \entry{Software Engineering MTS, VizQL Server -- Tableau (Salesforce)}{01/20 - Present}
  {
    \item Propagating exception metadata across the Tableau monolith to identify and prioritize SLA-impacting defects (current project)
    \item Enabled client teams to debug cross-language performance issues through contributions to Tableau's C++/Java telemetry library
    \item Identified and triaged key sources of customer dissatisfaction in Tableau Online through development of Tableau and Splunk dashboards to track golden signals and other metrics
    \item Set up Snowflake datasources for Tableau visualizations using ETLs written in Apache Flink and Kafka
    \item Prioritized key issues blocking Tableau Online from reaching three nines of availability by driving backlog work intake as team scrum-master
    \item Wrote design documents and technical specifications for automation to automatically detect and triage SLA-impacting defects across the Analytics org
    \item Enabled VizQL Server to consistently self-heal by unifying VizQL Server healthchecks, removing a class of high-visibility defects
    \item Identified and debugged shipblocking production issues using Splunk, Tableau, and New Relic
  }
  \entry{Research and Development Intern -- Sandia National Laboratories}{06/18 - 08/19}
