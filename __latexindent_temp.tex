\begin{cvsection}{Experience}
  \entry{Software Engineering MTS @ Tableau (Salesforce)}{01/20 - Present}
  {
    \item Flink / ODP
    \item ART
    \item Error codes
    \item Availability + triaging
    \item monitoring maturity with Splunk Tableau
    \item Healthcheck

    \item Develop on ART, Tableau's homegrown tracing framework for internal use
    \item Help drive use of error codes for exceptions across the codebase for
        quicker mean-time-to-resolution of newly introduced defects
    \item Implemented data pipelines to track errors and automatically file
        defects to our bug tracker (in progress)
    \item Developed automation and dashboards in Tableau, Splunk, and New
        Relic to reduce toil and tedious bug investigations
    \item Improved monitoring on errors in effort to reach three nines
        of availability for Tableau visualization loads (<99.5\% -> 99.8\%)
